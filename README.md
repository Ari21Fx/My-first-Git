Hello World!
And friends
This is my first repository, I am a freelance

I like HTML5, CSS and JS, AMP project, Bootstrap v4 and v5 and W3Schools

AMP project https://amp.dev/
AMP is an open source HTML framework that provides a simple way to create web pages that are fast, load smoothly, and prioritize user experience above all else.

Bootstrap v4 and v5 https://getbootstrap.com/
It is the world's most popular front-end open source toolkit.

W3 Schools https://www.w3schools.com/
I have learned many things in w3 Schools like html5, css and js
of them I have practiced with their w3css is a very light framework, fast and easy to use, modern responsive and mobile first you can see it in:
